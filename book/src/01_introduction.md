# Introduction

## What Is `gfx-hal`

The [gfx-hal](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal) crate is a cross platform graphics API
that attempts to be a minimal wrapping of the "modern, low level" graphics APIs
(DX12, Vulkan, and Metal).

To quote Icefox (lead of the GGEZ project):

> I think of Vulkan as basically being GPU assembly language, at least in terms
> of level of abstraction. Which is to say, there is very little abstraction: it
> gives you the parts that you have to work with, it has nothing stopping you
> from doing whatever you feel like with those parts, now go write stuff with
> it. No, there's no memory allocator. I just told you to go write stuff, didn't
> I? Write it. Comparatively, OpenGL is like GPU Javascript: It starts out
> convenient, but it's old, wacky, clunky, weird, has a million evolutionary
> versions and odd edge cases, and itâ€™s not really a convenient model for
> computation these days. Sure you can make it fast if you try, but you have to
> jump through lots of hoops to do so.

So this will be a _very long_ style of tutorial, because we'll have to be doing
oh-so-many little steps and configurations by hand as we learn to do each new
thing. If that's not your scene then sorry I guess, this tutorial might not be
for you.

## Requirements

I assume that you have basic familiarity with Rust. So go read [The Rust
Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) if you haven't ever done that.

We will also be touching upon elements of `unsafe` Rust, and so you should also
read [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/) if you have not.
Actually, that's a mild lie, most of `gfx-hal` doesn't define any of its safety
limits anyway (not beyond "whatever Vulkan say is okay"), so it's all a shot in
the dark no matter what you do. Even if you're using a backend that isn't
Vulkan.

I don't assume you have any prior graphics programming skills. I sure don't have
much myself. I drew a quad once in OpenGL, but that's it. We'll be learning and
reviewing all that stuff together.

The code all assumes that you're using **Rust 2018**.

When first writing this document I was using my personal `rustfmt.toml` file,
which mostly means 2 space tabs. When this book was transitioned to long term
maintenance mode I was encouraged to change to 4 space tabs because this is more
normal for the rust ecosystem. The actual source of the examples has been
updated, but the example blocks in the markdown files were left as is. So
there's a mild difference in the layout, but the code is the same.
