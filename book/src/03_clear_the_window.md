# Clearing The Window

Once you have a window open, the _usual_ next step for a graphics tutorial is to
draw "your first triangle". You see, the fundamental primitive of 3d graphics is
the triangle. Yes, there are some systems such as the [Sega
Saturn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn) that use quads instead, but
in all the modern systems you'll find it's going to be triangles. Even a quad is
just two triangles, when you think about it. With enough math and enough
parallel processing you can do anything you want with triangles.

* Skyrim? Triangles.
* Breath of The Wild? Has a few more triangles than Skyrim.
* Super Smash Bros? Just a whole lot of triangles.

We'll be covering triangles _quite_ a bit. However, in the context of `gfx-hal`,
which is like 97% "whatever Vulkan does", even if you're _not_ using the Vulkan
backend, there's a great _many_ steps of setup involved between "a window that
draws nothing" and "a window that draws one triangle".

In fact the [official gfx-hal docs](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/)
specifically give us a warning about this. The top level docs are so short I can
include all three sentences right here for dramatic effect:

> Low-level graphics abstraction for Rust. Mostly operates on data, not types.
> Designed for use by libraries and higher-level abstractions only.

There are basically no defaults provided. We have to list out every single
little step of the entire configuration process. I mean they convert C types
into Rust types for us, but it's still very "do it yourself". That's _cool_ if
you actually care about defining it all (which you will some day, I'm sure, or
you wouldn't be reading this right now), but it's also _long_ when you're
starting out and want to get something on the screen.

Since going all the way to "drawing a triangle" might end up feeling like too
much at once, we'll stop this lesson at an intermediate step. Remember how our
`winit` window from last lesson didn't refresh itself properly? We can fix just
that much and then stop there. That _alone_ will cover a surprising amount of
ground.

To be absolutely clear: _PLEASE_ understand that this is a whirlwind tour of
many corners of the whole process all at once. Since so much needs to be set up
before you can draw anything, quite a bit gets skimmed over simply so that we
can talk about all the parts. As it is, this lesson is still more than 10,000
words long. Future lessons will review different elements of what gets built
here, and I promise that it makes sense the more you stick with it.

## Outline Our Target API

So, in the first lesson we had `WinitState` and it just had two public fields.
There's not much there, it's all safe code, and it's not the focus of our
lessons, so that's fine. I mean I guess you could pair up the wrong `EventLoop`
with the wrong `Window` or something, but two public fields is good enough.

With `gfx-hal` it is _wildly_ the opposite situation. We're going to be juggling
a dozen or more things at once, and most of them are **very** unsafe things that
must be handled with extreme care. `gfx-hal`, at its core, is about directing a
pile of DMA units and a hyper-SIMD co-processor with all safety checks left in
"up to you" mode. That's _about_ as unsafe as it gets. Not only do we want a
`HalState` type, we want to expose _nothing_ that's inside of it, because it's
all a giant pile of sharp and dangerous things. We want to wrap all that up,
then offer a very small, well curated, semantically meaningful set of operations
that the outside world can access.

Sure sounds like API Design. There's so much that could be said about API
design. Let's keep it short:

* Always, _Always_, **_Always_** [write the usage code
  first.](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0025)

Even before we know _any details about how `gfx-hal` works_, we're going to just
write out how we _think_ we should be able to use it. How we think it would be
easiest to use. Once it's built we will be calling the methods a lot more than
we'll be implementing the methods, so unless we end up with some sort of
performance disaster or impossible requirement we'll keep the exterior simple
even if it means the interior might end up a little more complex.

So what's our _usage_ of the `HalState` type look like?

There's lots of answers you could have to that question. Really, there are.
Obviously since I'm writing this we're going to be using what I came up with,
but if you think you can get a better solution you should try it out. I'll try
to explain my thinking as best as I can, and hopefully you'll agree with me.

### Initialization

We already have `WinitState`, we're going to want `HalState` too. Clearly the
`WinitState` can be made before the `HalState` (since we did it last lesson).

We'll also want to have a `LocalState`, and that's the grab bag of everything
else in the program. If you're doing a game or a simulation or something that's
your `GameState` or `World` or whatever you wanna call the type.

So far the code outline looks like this:

```rust
fn main(){
  let mut winit_state = WinitState::default();
  let mut hal_state = HalState::default();
  let mut local_state = LocalState::default();
  // MAIN LOOP
  // CLEANUP
}
```

Except, when you think about it, the way that `gfx-hal` initializes itself
~~probably~~ definitely depends on the `Window` it's going to draw within. It
can't be totally default with no inputs. We need a `HalState` initialization
method that takes a `Window` reference. The default name for any initialization
method in Rust is just `new`, and I can't think of a better name to use, so
we'll go with that.

```rust
fn main(){
  let mut winit_state = WinitState::default();
  let mut hal_state = HalState::new(&winit_state.window);
  let mut local_state = LocalState::default();
  // MAIN LOOP
  // CLEANUP
}
```

Also, of course, our local variables might depend on all sorts of things in some
sort of application specific way. That part is up to you.

### Main Loop

Once things are all initialized and ready we go into the "main loop" part of the
program.

**Digression:** Video is really just a series of still pictures. You show one after
the other, very quickly, and a human brain interprets the existence of movement
where none "really" exists. Each picture is a "frame", and how quickly you go
from one frame to the next is the "frames per second" (fps). The minimum fps for
apparent movement is actually quite modest, you only need [about
12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate#Human_vision). More is better of
course, the movement appears smoother the more fps you have. People have been
animating for a long time and there's all sorts of standards by now, but on a
computer you're usually expected to be drawing at about 60fps for "good" quality
animation and 30fps for "I guess that's okay for something made in Unity"
quality animation.

**Back to code:** The implication here is that each pass through our main loop
will be one frame of display. We gather up the input for that frame, adjust our
local variables according to the input (eg: in a game you might move the player a tiny
bit, or whatever change), and then render the new state of the world into a frame that
gets shown to the user. Something like this:

```rust
fn main(){
  let winit_state = WinitState::default();
  let hal_state = HalState::new(&winit_state.window);
  let mut local_state = LocalState::default();
  loop {
    let inputs = UserInput::poll_events_loop(&mut winit_state.event_loop);
    if inputs.end_requested {
      break;
    }
    local_state.update_from_input(inputs);
    do_the_render(&mut hal_state, &local_state);
  }
  // CLEANUP
}
```

This should look fairly familiar after what we did in the first lesson.

You may be wondering why the `do_the_render` function is taking a `&mut
HalState` as the first argument, instead of having it be a `&mut self` method on
the `HalState` type. Well, I'm not sure it's the perfect decision, but we're
going to _try_ and keep our `HalState` and `LocalState` as totally separate as
we can.

* If `HalState` doesn't know anything about the `LocalState` then it's a lot
  more likely to focus on reusable drawing operations, and we'll be a lot more
  likely to have something we can reuse in future situations (including
  "practical" situations beyond just this tutorial series).
* Similarly, if `LocalState` doesn't know about `HalState` then it's easier for
  it to focus on the "business logic" without worrying about anything else. We
  could even run the `LocalState` _without graphics at all_ (sometimes called a
  "headless" mode), which can be nice if you want to do CI tests, or hook it to
  a server people connect to, or any other unexpected use.

It can often be _tempting_ to make everything into a method on some type, but
that's an urge we need to resist in this situation.

### What Does `do_the_render` Actually Do?

I cheated a bit there, because I wrote down a call to `do_the_render` without
actually saying _what_ it's doing on the inside. That's the part we care about
the most! That's how we know what our `HalState` API needs to look like.

For this lesson, all we do is clear the screen. That sounds simple enough. Later
lessons will add more, but this is our starting point.

```rust
pub fn do_the_render(hal: &mut HalState, locals: &LocalState) {
  hal.draw_clear_frame(locals.color());
}
```

That looks okay at first, but there might be some sort of error that happens
during rendering. Nothing inside `do_the_render` particularly knows about how to
handle an error, so we'll just pass that back up the stack.

```rust
pub fn do_the_render(hal: &mut HalState, locals: &LocalState) -> Result<(), &str> {
  hal.draw_clear_frame(locals.color())
}
```

And then in `main` I guess we can just... log the error and quit? It's not ideal
for the program to shut itself down unexpectedly, but we don't really have a
backup strategy at the moment. In a more advanced situation the error might be
from the user trying to switch graphics settings or something, so you could
automatically switch back to the previous settings in that case. Depends on the
program, and the error.

Also, in a full program you'd want to use a proper error enum, but we don't know
what all our possible errors are, so we'll just use string literals for now.

Anyway, now things look more like this:

```rust
fn main(){
  let winit_state = WinitState::default();
  let hal_state = HalState::new(&winit_state.window);
  let mut local_state = LocalState::default();
  loop {
    let inputs = UserInput::poll_events_loop(&mut winit_state.event_loop);
    if inputs.end_requested {
      break;
    }
    local_state.update_from_input(inputs);
    if let Err(e) = do_the_render(&mut hal_state, &local_state) {
      error!("Rendering Error: {:?}", e);
      break;
    }
  }
  // CLEANUP
}
```

### Cleanup

Usually when working with "foreign" data, anything that comes from outside of
Rust, you have to consider the possibility that you'll have to manually do some
cleanup work. `gfx-hal` is no different. Not only do we need to clean things up
to avoid leaks when we're done, we need to clean up in the exactly correct
order. The backend code can segfault your process just by you not shutting it
down properly.

How do we expose this in our API?

We _don't_.

I'm not saying that we _ignore_ the subject of cleanup, that would be foolish,
but I am saying that we should keep all of it entirely within the `HalState`
type. Things are smoothest for the user when they can just let a type drop away
without a care, and we're going to try and allow for such an easy use
experience. Mostly what this means is that we won't want to have any "getter"
methods that let an outside user move out anything that needs to be manually
destroyed later. If they want to check the value of a number or maybe even get a
`&mut` to some that's fine, but anything that needs to be explicitly cleaned up
we can't let out of our control.

Now we can see our final outline:

```rust
fn main(){
  let winit_state = WinitState::default();
  let hal_state = HalState::new(&winit_state.window);
  let mut local_state = LocalState::default();
  loop {
    let inputs = UserInput::poll_events_loop(&mut winit_state.event_loop);
    if inputs.end_requested {
      break;
    }
    local_state.update_from_input(inputs);
    if let Err(e) = do_the_render(&mut hal_state, &local_state) {
      error!("Rendering Error: {:?}", e);
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

Will we achieve this? Hard to say without trying.

## Activate Logging Powers

As you write for `gfx-hal`, you'll definitely write stuff that's wrong. That's
just how it goes, no shame in it. There's so many rules and details that even
the `gfx-rs` team members don't know all of it all the time. They look at the
Vulkan spec to verify the rules just like anyone else has to. Thankfully, we can
avoid having too many bugs quietly creep into things by logging what's going on
inside the program and hopefully something will show up in the logs to explain
the problem when there is a problem.

### The `log` Crate

If you've ever done logging before you know that usually there's a "logging
facade" which defines a way to write log messages that libraries use, and then
there's an actual logging implementation that a binary will activate at the
start of a process to receive logging messages and deal with them. Rust is no
different.

You use the [log](https://docs.rs/log) crate to write a logging message. You use
[a logging implementation of
choice](https://docs.rs/log/0.4/log/#available-logging-implementations) to
actually process those logging messages. The actual macros for logging are just
like how `println!` works, but instead of being called `println!` there's one
macro for each "level" of logging. From most important to least important it
goes: `error!`, `warn!`, `info!`, `debug!` and `trace!`. Different logging
implementations let you limit the levels that actually get logged, and the
logging crate has features to restrict what logging messages even get compiled
in (so you can compile out all logging in release mode or whatever). It's a
whole huge thing you can really dig through if you want.

I don't want to. I want to not have any fuss. So we'll use
[simple_logger](https://crates.io/crates/simple_logger) which is exactly as easy
as it sounds. You write one line, once, and then logging messages just go to
`stdout` or `stderr`.

First we add things to our `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
log = "0.4"
simple_logger = "1"
winit = "0.19"
```

And then we turn on the `simple_logger` in main before we do anything else:

```rust
fn main() {
  simple_logger::init().unwrap();
  // ...
```

And now we'll see anything that someone wanted to log. If we want to do our own
logging that's easy too:

```rust
#[allow(unused_imports)]
use log::{error, warn, info, debug, trace};
```

### LunarG Vulkan SDK

Next you'll also want some tools that _aren't_ strictly Rust related (shocking,
I know).

The [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) is a free set of
tools for all major operating systems. Once you install the SDK, if you're using
the `gfx-backend-vulkan` crate as your `gfx-hal` backend it'll log any
validation errors when `debug_assertions` are on. You don't need to do any
special setup, it just conveniently happens for you.

Unfortunately, when testing with other backends you're much more "on your own",
but some help is still better than zero help. You can set up Metal validation,
and I'll update here just as soon as one of the gfx team members with a mac
updates me on what to say.

## Adding In `gfx-hal` And A Backend

Adding `gfx-hal` to our `Cargo.toml` file comes in two parts. There's `gfx-hal`,
and also we need an actual "backend" that provides a specific implementation of
the types and operations that `gfx-hal` defines.

### Configuring Cargo

We want to keep the backend selection as easy to swap as possible. Normally this
is done at compile time, since there's only about one good backend per OS
anyway, and it keeps things simpler than trying to select a backend at startup.
The standard idiom for how to do this looks something like:

```toml
[features]
default = []
metal = ["gfx-backend-metal"]
dx12 = ["gfx-backend-dx12"]
vulkan = ["gfx-backend-vulkan"]

[dependencies]
log = "0.4"
simple_logger = "1"
winit = "0.19"
gfx-hal = "0.2"
arrayvec = "0.4"

[dependencies.gfx-backend-vulkan]
version = "0.2"
optional = true

[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies.gfx-backend-metal]
version = "0.2"
optional = true

[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies.gfx-backend-dx12]
version = "0.2"
optional = true
```

If you want the Rust Language Server (RLS) to play nice with the various
optional features you must tell it which one to use for its compilations. You
could specify a default feature, but that's not quite elegant. If you're using
VS Code with the RLS plugin you can instead make a `.vscode/settings.json` file
in your project folder, and then in there place a setting for the feature you
want it to use for RLS runs. Something like this:

```json
{
  "rust.features": [
    "dx12"
  ]
}
```

If you're using RLS with some editor besides VS Code I'm afraid I don't know the
details of how you tell RLS to use a particular feature, but you probably can.
Consult your plugin docs, and such.

### Configuring The Code

Over inside our main file we won't actually be importing too much from the
backends, but we'll place some conditional `use` statements so that they're
always aliased to the same name, regardless of what one we're using.

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "dx12")]
use gfx_backend_dx12 as back;
#[cfg(feature = "metal")]
use gfx_backend_metal as back;
#[cfg(feature = "vulkan")]
use gfx_backend_vulkan as back;
```

### Any Other Backend Options?

There _are_ other backend options that we haven't considered:

* [gfx-backend-empty](https://crates.io/crates/gfx-backend-empty) does nothing
  but provide the required implementations as empty structs and do-nothing
  methods and similar. It's mostly used in the rustdoc examples for `gfx-hal`,
  so that they can check that doctests compile properly. You might also use this
  with RLS I guess, but since you'll also need a real backend compiled to run
  any code, you might as well make RLS use your real backend.
* [gfx-backend-gl](https://crates.io/crates/gfx-backend-gl) lets you target
  OpenGL 2.1+ and OpenGL ES2+. You'd probably use this if you wanted to run
  inside a webpage, or perhaps on a Raspberry Pi (which has OpenGL ES2 drivers,
  but not Vulkan), or anything else where you can't pick one of the "main"
  options. Unfortunately, the GL backend is actually a little busted at the
  moment. The biggest snag is that webpages and desktop apps have rather
  different control flow, so it's hard to come up with a unified API. Work is
  being done, and hopefully soon I'll be able to recommend the GL backend.

### Also `arrayvec`

As you might have noticed, we're going to be using
[arrayvec](https://docs.rs/arrayvec) later on for the `ArrayVec` type. I don't
want to come back to `Cargo.toml` later, so we can just mention it now.

`ArrayVec` works basically just like `Vec` but it's backed by an array on the
stack, not a data blob on the heap, so it can't resize, but it also doesn't need
a heap allocation to construct. We'll be using it during our draw code so that
we can call a few critical functions without doing a heap allocation each frame.
The functions in question have some weird generic bounds that work out for `Vec`
and `ArrayVec` and similar, but not for arrays themselves. Generics just be like
that sometimes.

# Implementing `draw_clear_frame`

You might think that we'd start by learning how to initialize things, but
actually our core goal is clearing the screen. Anything else that we do,
including the initialization, is _only in service to that goal_. So first we'll
focus on our core goal, then we'll see what we need for that, and then we'll see
what we need for _that_, until eventually we stop needing to have already done
something else.

We'll be filling in this method:

```rust
impl HalState {
  pub fn draw_clear_frame(&mut self, color: [f32; 4]) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    unimplemented!()
  }
}
```

## CommandQueue

The heart of it all is that we want to be able to safely call
[CommandQueue::submit](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/queue/struct.CommandQueue.html#method.submit),
which submits a list of work which we define in a `CommandBuffer` to the GPU (in
this case just clearing the image), and then we call
[Swapchain::present](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/trait.Swapchain.html#method.present),
which instructs the GPU to wait until the CommandQueue work is done and
"present" the completed image into the Swapchain.

_Exactly_ what happens at that point depends on how you've configured the
Swapchain, which we'll talk about in the initialization section. The important
part to remember here is that `Swapchain::present` is effectively a
**non-blocking** call. If you're used to using OpenGL you might expect `present`
to be the point where your loop halts until Vsync, but with `gfx-hal` anything
that makes the CPU wait on the GPU is controlled via "Fences" (which we'll see
in a moment), and that doesn't include `present`.

### `submit`

The actual type of the `submit` method is _super generic_ which means that it
reads like a pile of space runes:

```rust
pub unsafe fn submit<'a, T, Ic, S, Iw, Is>(
    &mut self,
    submission: Submission<Ic, Iw, Is>,
    fence: Option<&B::Fence>
)
where
    T: 'a + Submittable<B, C, Primary>,
    Ic: IntoIterator<Item = &'a T>,
    S: 'a + Borrow<B::Semaphore>,
    Iw: IntoIterator<Item = (&'a S, PipelineStage)>,
    Is: IntoIterator<Item = &'a S>,
```

Gross, right? Let's cut out those generics and look again:

```rust
pub unsafe fn submit(&mut self, submission: Submission, fence: Option<&B::Fence>)
```

Okay that's _way_ easier to look at and understand. It's just a rustified
version of
[vkQueueSubmit](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/vkQueueSubmit.html).
Which doesn't mean anything to you right now because we're just starting, but
like I said at the top: if the `gfx-hal` docs aren't clear on their semantics,
you can usually assume that Vulkan semantics apply.

* We `submit` a `Submission` into the `CommandQueue`. Instead of giving a count
  and a pointer to an array of "VkSubmitInfo", we give a single `Submission`,
  which is itself composed of `IntoIterator` things that I assume get iterated
  over. _Unfortunately_, since each backend has to handle the info in slightly
  different ways, we have to pay for that cross-platform benefit by things
  sometimes being a little less clear on our end.
* We optionally give a "fence" which gets "signalled" once all of the submitted
  command buffers have completed execution. We'll talk about that in a moment.

### `present`

The `present` method looks like this

```rust
unsafe fn present<'a, C, S, Iw>(
    &'a self,
    present_queue: &mut CommandQueue<B, C>,
    image_index: SwapImageIndex,
    wait_semaphores: Iw
) -> Result<Option<Suboptimal>, PresentError>
where
    Self: 'a + Sized + Borrow<B::Swapchain>,
    C: Capability,
    S: 'a + Borrow<B::Semaphore>,
    Iw: IntoIterator<Item = &'a S>,
```

And if we cut out the extra stuff:

```rust
unsafe fn present(
    &self,
    present_queue: &mut CommandQueue<B, C>,
    image_index: SwapImageIndex,
    wait_semaphores: Iw) -> Result<Option<Suboptimal>, PresentError>
```

So `present` takes a `&mut` to our `CommandQueue`, a target index within the
Swapchain to present to, and a semaphore to wait on before actually presenting
the image. This works like
[vkQueuePresentKHR](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/vkQueuePresentKHR.html).
When we call `submit`, one of the Submission elements is going to be a semaphore
to signal when the rendering is done. When we call `present` we give it that
same semaphore to wait on before presenting the image, so that the user only
sees complete images.

### Fences?

A [fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_barrier) (aka
[VkFence](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkFence.html))
is one of the two synchronization primitives we'll be dealing with. It's
basically just a bool, it can "signaled" or "unsignaled". You can share a fence
between threads and everyone always sees the current state, so it's _like_
having an
[AtomicBool](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicBool.html).

Fences are for CPU to GPU synchronization. The CPU can wait on a fence, and the
GPU will signal the fence when it's done whatever it's supposed to have done.

### Semaphores?

A [semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)) (aka
[VkSemaphore](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSemaphore.html))
is the other synchronization primitive that we deal with. In some contexts (eg:
`winapi`) a semaphore can be any integer value, but in a Vulkan / `gfx-hal`
context they can only be "signaled" or "unsignaled".

The big difference between a fence and a semaphore is that semaphores are for
GPU to GPU synchronization. When once part of a graphics pipeline (such as
presentation to the swapchain) depends on another part of the pipeline (such as
command buffer processing), then you describe that dependency to the GPU using a
semaphore.

## Submission

Supposing that we already have a `CommandQueue` from somewhere, we need to give
it a `Submission` of what to do.

```rust
pub struct Submission<Ic, Iw, Is> {
    pub command_buffers: Ic,
    pub wait_semaphores: Iw,
    pub signal_semaphores: Is,
}
```

Hmm, but the `submit` method had extra bounds in there:

```rust
  T: 'a + Submittable<B, C, Primary>,
  Ic: IntoIterator<Item = &'a T>,
  S: 'a + Borrow<B::Semaphore>,
  Iw: IntoIterator<Item = (&'a S, PipelineStage)>,
  Is: IntoIterator<Item = &'a S>,
```

So if we put that together, and allow ourselves to use some slightly fake Rust
syntax for just a moment, we need to build this:

```rust
pub struct Submission {
    pub command_buffers: IntoIterator<Item = &'a Submittable<B, C, Primary>>,
    pub wait_semaphores: IntoIterator<Item = (&'a Borrow<B::Semaphore>, PipelineStage)>,
    pub signal_semaphores: IntoIterator<Item = &'a Borrow<B::Semaphore>>,
}
```

* `command_buffers` is our
  [Submittable](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/command/trait.Submittable.html)
  things, which are `Borrow<B::CommandBuffer>`, so we can think of that as being
  _sorta_ like `&[CommandBuffer]`.
* `wait_semaphores` gives the semaphores that this submission has to _wait on
  before it starts_. Each semaphore is paired with a
  [PipelineStage](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/pso/struct.PipelineStage.html),
  allowing your submission to wait for a stage, do some work at that stage, wait
  for another stage, do some more work at the new stage, and so on.
* `signal_semaphores` gives a list of semaphores that this submission _will
  signal once it completes_. It doesn't say, but I'm guessing that all the
  semaphores just get signaled at once at the end of the Submission.

All of this is basically what you find in the
[VkSubmitInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkSubmitInfo.html)
struct.

### ArrayVec Submissions

Remember when I said that we'd use the ArrayVec to avoid allocations per frame?
That's this part. It's simple really. Instead of writing something like:

```rust
let command_buffers = vec![the_command_buffer];
```

You write something like

```rust
let command_buffers: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [the_command_buffer].into();
```

## Submitting And Presenting

So far it sounds like we want something like this

```rust
  pub fn draw_clear_frame(&mut self, color: [f32; 4]) -> Result<(), &str> {
    // SETUP FOR THIS FRAME
    // ...

    // RECORD SOME COMMANDS
    // ...

    // SUBMISSION
    let command_buffers: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [the_command_buffer].into();
    let wait_semaphores: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [(image_available, PipelineStage::COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT)].into();
    let signal_semaphores: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [render_finished].into();
    let present_wait_semaphores: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [render_finished].into();
    let submission = Submission {
      command_buffers,
      wait_semaphores,
      signal_semaphores,
    };
    unsafe {
      the_command_queue.submit(submission, Some(flight_fence));
      the_swapchain.present(&mut the_command_queue, i_u32, present_wait_semaphores)
        .map(|_| ())
        .map_err(|_|"Failed to present into the swapchain!")
    }
  }
```

For all my fuss about things being so "manual and on your own", that seems
fairly reasonable so far.

## Recording Commands

So we need to fill up a
[CommandBuffer](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/command/struct.CommandBuffer.html)
with the operations that we want to have happen during the draw process.

All we want to do is clear the screen, that's got to be easy enough.

Well, it turns out that a CommandBuffer isn't totally free to make, so we want
to make them ahead of time and then pick out and use a particular command buffer
each frame. That's easy, we can change our Submission declaration very easily.
Also, before it's part of the Submission, we want to grab a `&mut` to the
particular command buffer and write to it. That calls for the ever-lovable
"inner scope" so that the `&mut` goes away and we can take a `&` to our buffer
instead. Thankfully (I guess), recording to a CommandBuffer is all unsafe, so
we can kill two birds with one stone.

A CommandBuffer is actually wrapping around a
[RawCommandBuffer](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/command/trait.RawCommandBuffer.html)
with some metadata for bonus type safety. All the real documentation is given on
the RawCommandBuffer type.

We start by calling `begin`

```rust
pub unsafe fn begin(&mut self, allow_pending_resubmit: bool)
```

To begin the buffer overall. Then we start a particular render pass with

```rust
pub unsafe fn begin_render_pass_inline<T>(
    &mut self,
    render_pass: &B::RenderPass,
    frame_buffer: &B::Framebuffer,
    render_area: Rect,
    clear_values: T
) -> RenderPassInlineEncoder<B>
where
    T: IntoIterator,
    T::Item: Borrow<ClearValue>,
```

Which records a render pass with no secondary command buffers.

Next we... immediately finish the render pass. The RenderPass struct will define
how to deal with the color buffer, including the clear effect, and the
ClearValue just picks what color to clear to.

Note: images can have more than just color data, so we have to put the "clear to
this color" part into an iterator. In more advanced code you'd specify the clear
color and also the clear depth value (they're both part of the
[ClearValue](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/command/enum.ClearValue.html)
enum). We're not using the depth buffer at the moment, so it's just a 1 element
array.

After that, we're already done.

```rust
  pub fn draw_clear_frame(&mut self, color: [f32; 4]) -> Result<(), &str> {
    // SETUP FOR THIS FRAME
    // ...

    // RECORD SOME COMMANDS
    {
      let buffer = &mut self.command_buffers[i_usize];
      let clear_values = [ClearValue::Color(ClearColor::Float(color))];
      buffer.begin(false);
      buffer.begin_render_pass_inline(
        &self.render_pass,
        &self.swapchain_framebuffers[i_usize],
        self.render_area,
        clear_values.iter(),
      );
      buffer.finish();
    }

    // SUBMISSION
    // ...
  }
```

## Frame Setup

What's left to do as setup? Well, the GPU can be doing more than one of these
buffer things at once. When you've got several images all going on it's called
having frames "in flight". At the start of each frame of work, we have to pick
the right fences and semaphores and all that for the current frame that we're
going to be working with. The simplest way is to just keep them in parallel
vectors and go through them like a ring buffer.

However, even once we've picked our current sync primitives, we have to
[acquire](https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/vkAcquireNextImageKHR.html)
a particular image to work with out of the swapchain. We don't move the whole
image out of the swapchain, we just get an index to target later with the
`present` method.

## Final `draw_clear_frame` Code

So now we put it all together, with the signaling in big caps to help make it
clear.

* Grab an image index that will SIGNAL the `image_available` semaphore once it's
  fully ready.
* Get our sync primitives out of our ring buffers
* WAIT on the `flight_fence` for this image index to know we're in the clear to
  use this position of our ring buffer.
* Reset that fence so we can pass it as part of our submission later.
* Record our command buffer while we're waiting for that.
* Submit a command buffer to WAIT on `image_available` and SIGNAL both
  `render_finished` and `flight_fence`.
* Present the results into the swapchain after a WAIT on `render_finished`

```rust
  /// Draw a frame that's just cleared to the color specified.
  pub fn draw_clear_frame(&mut self, color: [f32; 4]) -> Result<(), &str> {
    // SETUP FOR THIS FRAME
    let image_available = &self.image_available_semaphores[self.current_frame];
    let render_finished = &self.render_finished_semaphores[self.current_frame];
    // Advance the frame _before_ we start using the `?` operator
    self.current_frame = (self.current_frame + 1) % self.frames_in_flight;

    let (i_u32, i_usize) = unsafe {
      let (image_index, _) = self
        .swapchain
        .acquire_image(core::u64::MAX, Some(image_available), None)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't acquire an image from the swapchain!")?;
      (image_index, image_index as usize)
    };

    let flight_fence = &self.in_flight_fences[i_usize];
    unsafe {
      self
        .device
        .wait_for_fence(flight_fence, core::u64::MAX)
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to wait on the fence!")?;
      self
        .device
        .reset_fence(flight_fence)
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't reset the fence!")?;
    }

    // RECORD COMMANDS
    unsafe {
      let buffer = &mut self.command_buffers[i_usize];
      let clear_values = [ClearValue::Color(ClearColor::Float(color))];
      buffer.begin(false);
      buffer.begin_render_pass_inline(
        &self.render_pass,
        &self.framebuffers[i_usize],
        self.render_area,
        clear_values.iter(),
      );
      buffer.finish();
    }

    // SUBMISSION AND PRESENT
    let command_buffers = &self.command_buffers[i_usize..=i_usize];
    let wait_semaphores: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [(image_available, PipelineStage::COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OUTPUT)].into();
    let signal_semaphores: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [render_finished].into();
    // yes, you have to write it twice like this. yes, it's silly.
    let present_wait_semaphores: ArrayVec<[_; 1]> = [render_finished].into();
    let submission = Submission {
      command_buffers,
      wait_semaphores,
      signal_semaphores,
    };
    let the_command_queue = &mut self.queue_group.queues[0];
    unsafe {
      the_command_queue.submit(submission, Some(flight_fence));
      self
        .swapchain
        .present(the_command_queue, i_u32, present_wait_semaphores)
        .map(|_| ())
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to present into the swapchain!")
    }
  }
```

# Initializing `HalState`

So for our `draw_clear_frame` method to work it expects that we have many things
on hand as part of `HalState`. Listing them in the order that they're used:

* fences (requires a Device + frames_in_flight)
* semaphores (requires a Device + frames_in_flight)
* current_frame (just starts at 0)
* frames_in_flight (comes from the Swapchain)
* device (requires an Adapter)
* swapchain (requires a Surface+Adapter+Device)
* command_buffers (requires a CommandPool)
* render_pass (requires a Device)
* swapchain_framebuffers (requires ImageView values)
* render_area (comes from the Swapchain)
* queue_group (requires an Adapter)

But, as you can probably guess, that's _not_ the order that they're initialized.
You should have noticed that there's some things on there we haven't even
discussed yet, which also have their requirements. In no particular order:

* image_views (requires Device)
* Command Pool (requires Device)
* Surface (requires an Instance+Window)
* Adapter (requires an Instance)
* Instance

Now we just re-order it all so that nothing is built before the parts it depends
on. We'll even add some names to the build phases to help group it mentally:

* Top Level Stuff
  * Instance
  * Surface (requires an Instance+Window)
  * Adapter (requires an Instance)
  * queue_group (requires an Adapter)
  * device (requires an Adapter)
* The GPU Swapchain
  * swapchain (requires a Surface+Adapter+Device)
  * render_area (comes from the Swapchain)
  * frames_in_flight (comes from the Swapchain)
  * fences (requires a Device + frames_in_flight)
  * semaphores (requires a Device + frames_in_flight)
* RenderPass
  * render_pass (requires a Device + Swapchain format)
* Targets For Rendering
  * image_views (requires a Device)
  * framebuffers (requires ImageView values)
* Command Issuing
  * Command Pool (requires Device)
  * command_buffers (requires a CommandPool + Swapchain)
* Misc
  * current_frame (just starts at 0)

Notice that after the initial top level stuff you can do the other general
phases in about any order you want. You use the parts that they each build all
at once during rendering, but they can be constructed and configured
independently.

Also, there's many other things that a person might initialize in `gfx-hal`.
That's why we looked at how to submit the command we wanted first, so we don't
go wandering off initializing all sorts of things we don't end up needing.

And I guess we can just copy this outline as our outline for the explanation of
each step too. Nice when things work out like that.

## Top Level Stuff

Alright, so we're going to initialize a `HalState`. Well, just as with drawing,
there might be any number of problems that come up during this many step
process.

So the method we're filling in looks like this:

```rust
impl HalState {
  pub fn new(window: &Window) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
    unimplemented!()
  }
}
```

### Instance

An `Instance` is a backend specific black box. It's the handle that you hold to
prove that you've activated the backend API, and when it drops the backend tries
to close down, so you have to hold on to it at the very end and let it go last.

For something so important, you'd imagine that there's a dedicated trait for
them, and [you'd be
right](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/trait.Instance.html). You'd also
expect that the trait includes a way to create them instead of leaving it up to
convention, and you'd be wrong.

Still, it's very easy. We give an instance name and a version and the details of
how that's used depend on the backend.

```rust
let instance = back::Instance::create(WINDOW_NAME, 1);
```

### Surface

The [Surface](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/trait.Surface.html)
is an abstraction of how the `Window` (from `winit`) and your `Instance` (from
your `gfx-backend-whatever`) will actually be able to interact and show
something on the screen.

Similar to the Instance, it's very important, but also totally boring to create:

```rust
let mut surface = instance.create_surface(window);
```

As far as I can tell, it has no special cleanup operation. It probably shouldn't
outlive the Instance or the Window, but that's just a best guess.

### Adapter

The [Adapter](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/adapter/struct.Adapter.html)
is... _something_ that supports the usage of the API you've got an Instance for.
It's _probably_ a hardware GPU, but it could technically be a purely software
implementation.

We actually don't _make_ an Adapter, we pick one that already exists. Once we've
picked one, we haven't even made any changes to the system. Picking an Adapter
is like picking a IP address to connect to. It's one step to select the IP
address you want, and then another step to actually open a connection to that IP
address (which we'll do in a moment).

We have to call
[Instance::enumerate_adapters](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/trait.Instance.html#tymethod.enumerate_adapters),
which gives a vector of things to pick from. Our criteria here is based on the `queue_families: Vec<B::QueueFamily>` that each Adapter has. We want a QueueFamily

1) That supports Graphics
2) That our Surface supports

It's considered a bug in `gfx-hal` if any backend ever gives a QueueFamily that
has 0 max queues, so we don't need to bother checking that.

Since we're going over a vector, we can use some fancy Iterator stuff

```rust
let adapter = instance
  .enumerate_adapters()
  .into_iter()
  .find(|a| {
    a.queue_families
      .iter()
      .any(|qf| qf.supports_graphics() && surface.supports_queue_family(qf))
  })
  .ok_or("Couldn't find a graphical Adapter!")?;
```

### Device and QueueGroup

This is a "two things in one step" situation. From here on out we'll be doing a
lot of steps where we have an inner scope do to some setup, then we pass the
important data back up to the `new` method's primary scope. It's a Rust take on
what you might call "[Style
C](http://number-none.com/blow/blog/programming/2014/09/26/carmack-on-inlined-code.html)"
coding. We're just going to let the method get super long, with every single
step being as plain and obvious as possible, to see the full horror of what we're
doing.

The actual process here is easy enough to understand.

* Every Adapter has a
  [PhysicalDevice](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/adapter/trait.PhysicalDevice.html),
  and you call `open` to actually "connect" your program to that PhysicalDevice.
  This (hopefully) gives a Gpu. You have to pass in a list of QueueFamily values
  with a priority for each one.
* A [Gpu](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/struct.Gpu.html) is a pairing of
  a [Device](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/device/trait.Device.html)
  (which is a logical device, but you use it so often they wanted to make the
  name shorter) and a
  [Queues](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/queue/family/struct.Queues.html)
  value, which is a container for the different queues that we can now use.
* Once we've got the Queues, we pull out a particular
  [QueueGroup](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/queue/family/struct.QueueGroup.html)
  as well, which we use much later to build the CommandPool, and also it's how
  we `submit` our written CommandBuffer values of course.

```rust
let (device, queue_group) = {
  let queue_family = adapter
    .queue_families
    .iter()
    .find(|qf| qf.supports_graphics() && surface.supports_queue_family(qf))
    .ok_or("Couldn't find a QueueFamily with graphics!")?;
  let Gpu { device, mut queues } = unsafe {
    adapter
      .physical_device
      .open(&[(&queue_family, &[1.0; 1])], Features::empty())
      .map_err(|_| "Couldn't open the PhysicalDevice!")?
  };
  let queue_group = queues
    .take::<Graphics>(queue_family.id())
    .ok_or("Couldn't take ownership of the QueueGroup!")?;
  let _ = if queue_group.queues.len() > 0 {
    Ok(())
  } else {
    Err("The QueueGroup did not have any CommandQueues available!")
  }?;
  (device, queue_group)
};
```

Now, I can already _hear_ you trying to tell me that we shouldn't repeat the
`find` operation, but because of how the lifetimes work out we can't hang on to
a `queue_family` and also use our Adapter normally because the QueueFamily
reference keeps the Adapter borrowed the whole time, and it's a mess. **Even
if** we didn't care about lifetime issues the two `find` operations are actually
different because one works on `&` and the other is working on `&&` and we just
don't happen to _see_ the difference because of [Deref
coercion](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html?highlight=deref#implicit-deref-coercions-with-functions-and-methods).
It's fine to just do it twice, don't worry too much about it, really.

## The GPU Swapchain

The
[Swapchain](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/trait.Swapchain.html)
is like a collection of images on the GPU. They've got a linear index, like an
array or vector, and the GPU jumps around the Swapchain showing one image at any
given moment. This is where things start to get more configurable.

### Swapchain and friends

The basic idea is that you call
[Surface::compatibility](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/trait.Surface.html#tymethod.compatibility)
to get information about what sort of
[SwapchainConfig](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/struct.SwapchainConfig.html)
you're allowed to build, and then you call
[Device::create_swapchain](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/device/trait.Device.html#tymethod.create_swapchain)
with your Surface and the config you want. This gives you a Swapchain, which has
methods for controlling the GPU's swapchain, as well as a vector of images which
hold the handles to the particular Image data. We use an Image to make an
ImageView, and we use that to make a Framebuffer, and _that's_ what we're
manipulating with the CommandBuffer.

So what SwapchainConfig do we try to build? Well, the best one we can.
Unfortunately, this varies by quite a bit. Even if I just switch from the Vulkan
backend to the DX12 backend on a single machine the system ends up giving me
different compatibility results.

The SwapchainConfig type does have a `from_caps` method to try and help you
build a value, but it's error prone, because it does not take into account the
`PresentMode` capability that you have to pay attention to. We're not going to
use that, we'll just write out a struct literal ourselves. SwapchainConfig looks
like this:

```rust
pub struct SwapchainConfig {
  pub present_mode: PresentMode,
  pub composite_alpha: CompositeAlpha,
  pub format: Format,
  pub extent: Extent2D,
  pub image_count: SwapImageIndex,
  pub image_layers: Layer,
  pub image_usage: Usage,
}
```

* `present_mode`:
  [PresentMode](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/enum.PresentMode.html)
  gives us access to that sweet, sweet Vsync. Well, if it's available.
  * We would most like to have `Mailbox`, which lets us do "triple buffering".
    That's where you have at least 3 images, and one is "being shown" and then
    you render frames as quick as you can to different swapchain slots, always
    keeping the most recent complete frame ready. This gives the least amount of
    latency between user input and what they see on the screen.
  * We would accept `Fifo`, where frames are shown in the exact order that they're
    created. If you do this with 2 images you can have "double buffering" (where
    you show one frame and work on the next), but if you're using this with more
    than two images then it causes excess latency between input and display.
  * We would begrudgingly accept `Relaxed` if we had to use it, which "usually"
    has vsync but not always. I suppose this is for low-end machines. We want to
    avoid this if we can.
  * We would hate to have to use `Immediate`, where there's no vsync at all.
    That would just be terrible. We could live with it, but it'd be terrible
    because we'd have to sync the program ourselves to avoid eating up 100% of
    the core (and all of the user's battery, if they're on a mobile device).
* `composite_alpha`:
  [CompositeAlpha](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/struct.CompositeAlpha.html)
  controls how your window interacts with other windows within the user's UI.
  * For now we'd prefer `OPAQUE`, so that we just show our window "normally".
  * We'd also accept `NATIVE`, because we trust the user to have set things up
    how they want.
  * `PREMULTIPLIED` or `POSTMULTIPLIED` will almost certainly give "wrong"
    results because our graphics aren't smart enough to compensate for being
    forced into such a mode. Well, they'd be wrong if our graphics were anything
    more than a single clear color, but you know what I mean.
* `format`: The
  [Format](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/format/enum.Format.html) of the
  swapchain is how the data for each pixel is expected to exist in memory.
  _Normally_ we'd be a lot more interested, but since we're just clearing the
  screen it doesn't super matter. Still, we'll try to pick an sRGB format (which
  stands for "standard Red Green Blue"), just because that's what we'll be using
  in basically all the future lessons. Here we've got an `Option<Vec<_>>`, which
  means that the selection block will be silly and fiddly.
* `extent`: The
  [Extent2D](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/struct.Extent2D.html)
  describes a full sized rectangle (not a sub-rectangle), and selects a size for
  our images. Here's where we start using the SurfaceCapabilities that we got
  earlier. The SwapchainConfig `extent` that we use must be within the range
  that the `extents: Range<Extent2D>` field in our SurfaceCapabilities
  specifies. Note that the
  [Range](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/ops/struct.Range.html) type is
  semantically supposed to be _exclusive_ but both the Vulkan and DX12 backends
  use it wrong, so it's actually an inclusive value here.
  * As far as what extent we're actually going to pick, we'll go as big as we
    can. The Surface should should end up being the size of our Window, so our
    images are just "normal" size and it all works out.
* `image_count`: The
  [SwapImageIndex](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/window/type.SwapImageIndex.html)
  is just a `u32` for how many images we want in our Swapchain. Like I said, if
  we're going to be using `Mailbox` then we want 3, otherwise we'll go with 2.
  Note that we have to respect the `image_count: Range<SwapImageIndex>` field of
  the SurfaceCapabilities, which is _another_ field that is a Range but should
  actually be a RangeInclusive.
* `image_layers`: The
  [Layer](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/image/type.Layer.html) is just a
  `u16` for how many layers we want in our image. 1 is fine.
* `image_usage`: The
  [Usage](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/image/struct.Usage.html) defines
  how we'll be using the images in the swap chain in terms of the render pass
  stuff. We'll be using just color for now, so we check for that.

With that all done, we make the SwapchainConfig and then we use the Device to
build a Swapchain and images vector pair. This is a very vertical portion of
code, but not too much is actually happening.

```rust
let (swapchain, extent, images, format, frames_in_flight) = {
  let (caps, preferred_formats, present_modes) = surface.compatibility(&adapter.physical_device);
  info!("{:?}", caps);
  info!("Preferred Formats: {:?}", preferred_formats);
  info!("Present Modes: {:?}", present_modes);
  info!("Composite Alphas: {:?}", caps.composite_alpha);
  //
  let present_mode = {
    use gfx_hal::window::PresentMode::*;
    [Mailbox, Fifo, Relaxed, Immediate]
      .iter()
      .cloned()
      .find(|pm| present_modes.contains(pm))
      .ok_or("No PresentMode values specified!")?
  };
  let composite_alpha = {
    use gfx_hal::window::CompositeAlpha;
    [
        CompositeAlpha::OPAQUE,
        CompositeAlpha::INHERIT,
        CompositeAlpha::PREMULTIPLIED,
        CompositeAlpha::POSTMULTIPLIED,
    ]
    .iter()
    .cloned()
    .find(|ca| caps.composite_alpha.contains(*ca))
    .ok_or("No CompositeAlpha values specified!")?
  };
  let format = match preferred_formats {
    None => Format::Rgba8Srgb,
    Some(formats) => match formats
      .iter()
      .find(|format| format.base_format().1 == ChannelType::Srgb)
      .cloned()
    {
      Some(srgb_format) => srgb_format,
      None => formats.get(0).cloned().ok_or("Preferred format list was empty!")?,
    },

  } else {
      (caps.image_count.end - 1).min(caps.image_count.start.max(2))
  };
  let image_layers = 1;
  let image_usage = if caps.usage.contains(Usage::COLOR_ATTACHMENT) {
    Usage::COLOR_ATTACHMENT

    Err("The Surface isn't capable of supporting color!")?

  let swapchain_config = SwapchainConfig {

  (swapchain, extent, images, format, image_count as usize)
};
```

#### render_area

This is a [Rect](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/pso/struct.Rect.html)
version of our Extent2D. While an Extent2D is semantically the full area of an
image or texture (storing only width:`u32` and height:`u32`), a Rect is some
sub-portion of such an area (storing x,y,w,h, all `i16`). Note that your
sub-portion can totally just be "all of it".

#### frames_in_flight

This is just us storing how many images are in our Swapchain. As you saw when we
cleared the screen, we'll have one set of just about everything per frame in
flight.

### Fences and Semaphores

Generating the Fence and Semaphore values is quite boring. You just call
`create_fence` and `create_semaphore` on your Device value, over and over until
you have enough. Technically this might cause an OutOfMemory problem on the GPU,
but that's not very likely, so there's little chance that we'll have a problem
in this stage of things.

```rust
let (image_available_semaphores, render_finished_semaphores, in_flight_fences) = {
  let mut image_available_semaphores: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Semaphore> = vec![];
  let mut render_finished_semaphores: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Semaphore> = vec![];
  let mut in_flight_fences: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Fence> = vec![];
  for _ in 0..frames_in_flight {
    in_flight_fences.push(device.create_fence(true).map_err(|_| "Could not create a fence!")?);
    image_available_semaphores.push(device.create_semaphore().map_err(|_| "Could not create a semaphore!")?);
    render_finished_semaphores.push(device.create_semaphore().map_err(|_| "Could not create a semaphore!")?);
  }
  (image_available_semaphores, render_finished_semaphores, in_flight_fences)
};
```

## RenderPass

A RenderPass describes each part of the whole graphical processing for an image.
Well, actually it describes one "pass" which has various "sub-passes", but you
can also do multi-pass rendering, and then each pass can have its own
sub-passes. It's a lot of organization you might need to keep track of, but it
lets you be very precise about what happens when.

The RenderPass type has a backend specific definition so there's no general
struct here, not even a trait for them, unfortunately. Instead, you make one
with
[Device::create_render_pass](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/device/trait.Device.html#tymethod.create_render_pass).
This works a lot like that Submission stuff we had to deal with before, where
we'll have lists of stuff that all kinda get piled together. We need one
[Attachment](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/pass/struct.Attachment.html)
value (for the color), one
[SubpassDesc](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/pass/struct.SubpassDesc.html)
value (remember how we did a single "inline" render pass?), and then naturally
we have no
[SubpassDependency](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/pass/struct.SubpassDependency.html)
values since we only have a single subpass.

* Our Attachment needs
  * `format`: the format that we picked out for our Swapchain to be using.
  * `samples`: is only used when you get to multisampling, which is a later lesson.
  * `ops`: determines what to do with the data in this Attachment at the start
    of the subpass and at the end of the subpass. Remember how we recorded a
    command that set a clear color and nothing else? That didn't even do the
    clearing. _This_ is the part that does the clearing. When the subpass begins
    the old color value is all cleared. When the subpass ends the color values
    are stored.
  * `stencil_ops`: Is something we'll use later, but for now `DONT_CARE` is
    sufficient. I guess this is one of the few places where we kinda have a
    default to work with.
  * `layouts`: This lets us define the starting and ending pixel layout of the
    image we're processing. Each image has a pixel format which doesn't change
    from pass to pass, but it also has a layout that does change from pass to
    pass. It depends on what the image is being used for. In our case it starts
    as Undefined (since nothing happened before this) and it ends with Present
    (since we're done and want to present the image). Once again, we're using a
    Range when the type _should be_ RangeInclusive, or even maybe just a tuple.
* Our SubpassDesc needs the color attachment, and no others. This is where you
  _can_ get really fancy with "post-processing effects" type of stuff. We just
  need one
  [AttachmentRef](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/pass/type.AttachmentRef.html)
  for our colors. An ID value (0 is fine) and a layout. _During_ this pass we'll
  be affecting the color, so we'll pick `ColorAttachmentOptimal`. Well, we don't
  affect the colors after the clear during this tutorial, but once we start
  drawing stuff it'll matter, so we might as well set it now.

```rust
let render_pass = {
  let color_attachment = Attachment {
    format: Some(format),
    samples: 1,
    ops: AttachmentOps {
      load: AttachmentLoadOp::Clear,
      store: AttachmentStoreOp::Store,
    },
    stencil_ops: AttachmentOps::DONT_CARE,
    layouts: Layout::Undefined..Layout::Present,
  };
  let subpass = SubpassDesc {
    colors: &[(0, Layout::ColorAttachmentOptimal)],
    depth_stencil: None,
    inputs: &[],
    resolves: &[],
    preserves: &[],
  };
  unsafe {
    device
      .create_render_pass(&[color_attachment], &[subpass], &[])
      .map_err(|_| "Couldn't create a render pass!")?
  }
};
```

## Targets For Rendering

We've got all these images, but we can't use them as it is. The backend wants to
know more because it wants all the memory for each step to be as perfectly laid
out as possible.

### ImageView

First we have to take the Images and then make one ImageView each. This adds the
metadata to each image on how we're using it.

There's not too much to say about the process here. It's just a simple map
operation where we call
[Device::create_image_view](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/device/trait.Device.html#tymethod.create_image_view)
a bunch and collect it all up.

We've seen some of this before.

* [ViewKind](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/image/enum.ViewKind.html)
  lets us pick that we want this ImageView to be a 2D image, which is already
  enough of a heads up to know that an "Image" can get pretty weird the farther
  we go into this and the more types of ViewKind we eventually use.
* [Swizzle](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/format/struct.Swizzle.html)
  gives you the ability to transition between two different color channel
  orderings, but we have no need for that now so we can use the `NO` constant.
* [SubresourceRange](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/image/struct.SubresourceRange.html)
  lets us pick what sub-resources (eg: Color / Depth / Stencil) are used at what
  mipmap levels (think "zoom levels"), and in what parts of the array (if our
  image is an array, which it's not).

```rust
let image_views: Vec<_> = images
    .into_iter()
    .map(|image| unsafe {
      device
        .create_image_view(
          &image,
          ViewKind::D2,
          format,
          Swizzle::NO,
          SubresourceRange {
            aspects: Aspects::COLOR,
            levels: 0..1,
            layers: 0..1,
          },
        )
        .map_err(|_| "Couldn't create the image_view for the image!")
    })
    .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, &str>>()?;
```

### Framebuffer

Once we've got our ImageView values set, we can get one Framebuffer for each
with
[Device::create_framebuffer](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/device/trait.Device.html#tymethod.create_framebuffer).
This is what we actually target with our CommandBuffer recordings. It's another
quick map operation, even less to say than with the ImageViews.

```rust
let framebuffers: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Framebuffer> = {
  image_views
    .iter()
    .map(|image_view| unsafe {
      device
        .create_framebuffer(
          &render_pass,
          vec![image_view],
          Extent {
            width: extent.width as u32,
            height: extent.height as u32,
            depth: 1,
          },
        )
        .map_err(|_| "Failed to create a framebuffer!")
    })
    .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, &str>>()?
};
```

There's a use of `vec!` in there that we _could_ avoid with the same ArrayVec
deal that we used before, but this is startup code so we don't quite need to
bother. We'll only have 2 or 3 framebuffers anyway, it's fine.

## Command Issuing

We're in the home stretch, we just need to initialize the ability to issue
commands so we can put all these other things into use.

It's so simple we won't even use sub-sections:

```rust
let mut command_pool = unsafe {
  device
    .create_command_pool_typed(&queue_group, CommandPoolCreateFlags::RESET_INDIVIDUAL)
    .map_err(|_| "Could not create the raw command pool!")?
};
```

The `RESET_INDIVIDUAL` flag lets us reset individual command buffers that come
out of this pool (without the flag you have to reset the whole pool at once).

Once we have a CommandPool we make it give us one CommandBuffer for each
Framebuffer that we ended up with.

```rust
let command_buffers: Vec<_> = framebuffers.iter().map(|_| command_pool.acquire_command_buffer()).collect();
```

### current_frame

I guess you could say that this is part of the command issuing maybe? I don't
know, but we've been initializing for a super long time and I'm getting sick of
it, so you probably are too. This value is just a `usize` tracking what set of
stuff to use, and it starts at 0.

# Cleaning Up `HalState`

There's two situations where we'd need to clean up the `HalState` stuff:

* Drop triggering, for any reason: Easy to do, we'll show that in a moment, once
  we've talked about this other situation we have to handle
* `new` returning before the `HalState` struct is actually declared (which means
  that `HalState::drop` doesn't get called): Very un-ergonomic to handle
  properly. Like, seriously it's bad. You could re-arrange all of the code so
  that _every single_ early return (the `?` parts) is actually resource safe,
  but we're totally not even going to do that. It's just too terrible to try.
  Every single potential early return would create a new indentation for the
  main code and a custom cleanup block we'd have to write in the error case. I
  don't even want to think about it.

Why so? Well, almost none of the resource types are self-destructing, so even
though an early return causes them to die [in the proper
order](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1857-stabilize-drop-order.md)
(that is, we _always_ want LIFO destruction), their moment of destruction
doesn't actually _do_ anything because they don't have their own Drop code.
_This isn't anyone's fault_. I know in a few spots I've taken a few jabs at the
gfx team for using Range instead of RangeInclusive or something like that, but
this one they really can't fix.

Anything that comes from `Device::create_foo` needs to be destroyed by calling
`Device::destroy_foo` using that same device. So, either we need to have a
globally set Device value so that anyone's drop code can call `destroy_*` at any
time (rather bad to have such a global), or every single thing to later be
destroyed has to carry with it a copy of the Device so that they can use it to
destroy themselves (arguably worse in terms of overhead). It's just... it's just
not a good situation at all. We'll just have to be aware that our HalState
initialization code is just fundamentally broken for early returns, and it
probably always will be.

What are the _consequences_ for any kind of improper resource destruction like
that? Well, it depends. Which is terrible to have to say, but it does. _Usually_
you get a resource leak but life goes on as long as everything that comes out of
your Instance goes away before your Instance does. If you try to destroy the
Instance before things that came out of it you'll (probably) segfault your
process on the Vulkan backend. DX12 doesn't seem to mind. I don't know about
Metal since I don't own a mac.

I feel about as bad for being so vague about it as you probably feel for having
to read it, but these are just the troubles with FFI.

### Waiting Until Idle

The first thing we do in the drop method is wait for the device to go idle. It's
not legal to destroy resources that are in use, so we just give it a moment to
cool down by calling
[Device::wait_idle](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.2/gfx_hal/device/trait.Device.html#tymethod.wait_idle).
This could technically error, but at this point we're tearing it all down so we
don't care about the error. The device had its chance and now we're in charge.

### Basic Destruction

As I said, anything that comes from `Device::create_foo` needs to go back to a
`Device::destroy_foo` call. If those things are stored in vectors, it's easy to
drain out the vector and destroy them one at a time.

```rust
impl core::ops::Drop for HalState {
  /// We have to clean up "leaf" elements before "root" elements. Basically, we
  /// clean up in reverse of the order that we created things.
  fn drop(&mut self) {
    let _ = self.device.wait_idle();
    unsafe {
      for fence in self.in_flight_fences.drain(..) {
        self.device.destroy_fence(fence)
      }
```

And so on, for all of the things that are stored in vectors.

### ManuallyDrop

What do we do about things that aren't stored in vectors? We need to pass them
to `destroy_foo` but that's by-value and we can't move them out of a borrowed
context (since we're using `&mut self` within the `drop` call).

The answer is that we cheat.

If we just use
[core::ptr::read](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/ptr/fn.read.html) we can make a
duplicate of any bits we want. The type doesn't even have to be Clone! It's as
unsafe as it sounds. How do we offset some of that? With a marker struct called
[ManuallyDrop](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/mem/struct.ManuallyDrop.html),
which is magically known to the compiler, and the thing inside of the
ManuallyDrop will never run its own destructor automatically. When it's really
time to destroy the thing we can call `ManuallyDrop::into_inner` to unwrap the
value and pass it to some destroy function, or we can call `ManuallyDrop::drop`
to force the drop to happen on something that we don't have ownership of. We're
actually going to use _both_ styles.

For things that go with a `destroy_foo` method we'll use the `::into_inner`
style:

```rust
// The CommandPool must also be unwrapped into a RawCommandPool,
// so there's an extra `into_raw` call here.
self
  .device
  .destroy_command_pool(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&mut self.command_pool)).into_raw());
self
  .device
  .destroy_render_pass(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&mut self.render_pass)));
self
  .device
  .destroy_swapchain(ManuallyDrop::into_inner(read(&mut self.swapchain)));
```

And for our three final items we just use the `ManuallyDrop::drop` style:

```rust
ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut self.queue_group);
ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut self.device);
ManuallyDrop::drop(&mut self._instance);
```

# Final `HalState` Definition

Now that we know all of the fields that we have, including which ones are
wrapped in `ManuallyDrop`, we can look at our crazy, ugly, horrible `HalState`:

```rust
pub struct HalState {
  current_frame: usize,
  frames_in_flight: usize,
  in_flight_fences: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Fence>,
  render_finished_semaphores: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Semaphore>,
  image_available_semaphores: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Semaphore>,
  command_buffers: Vec<CommandBuffer<back::Backend, Graphics, MultiShot, Primary>>,
  command_pool: ManuallyDrop<CommandPool<back::Backend, Graphics>>,
  framebuffers: Vec<<back::Backend as Backend>::Framebuffer>,
  image_views: Vec<(<back::Backend as Backend>::ImageView)>,
  render_pass: ManuallyDrop<<back::Backend as Backend>::RenderPass>,
  render_area: Rect,
  queue_group: ManuallyDrop<QueueGroup<back::Backend, Graphics>>,
  swapchain: ManuallyDrop<<back::Backend as Backend>::Swapchain>,
  device: ManuallyDrop<back::Device>,
  _adapter: Adapter<back::Backend>,
  _surface: <back::Backend as Backend>::Surface,
  _instance: ManuallyDrop<back::Instance>,
}
```

# Everything Else

Now we just fill in those final bits that aren't the `HalState` materials.

## `UserInput`

For input, we'll just track a few of the possible things:

* If a close was requested.
* The frame's new size (if any).
* The mouse's new position (if any).

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Default)]
pub struct UserInput {
  pub end_requested: bool,
  pub new_frame_size: Option<(f64, f64)>,
  pub new_mouse_position: Option<(f64, f64)>,
}
impl UserInput {
  pub fn poll_events_loop(events_loop: &mut EventsLoop) -> Self {
    let mut output = UserInput::default();
    events_loop.poll_events(|event| match event {
      Event::WindowEvent {
        event: WindowEvent::CloseRequested,
        ..
      } => output.end_requested = true,
      Event::WindowEvent {
        event: WindowEvent::Resized(logical),
        ..
      } => {
        output.new_frame_size = Some((logical.width, logical.height));
      }
      Event::WindowEvent {
        event: WindowEvent::CursorMoved { position, .. },
        ..
      } => {
        output.new_mouse_position = Some((position.x, position.y));
      }
      _ => (),
    });
    output
  }
}
```

## `LocalState`

Currently, the locals are just the user input, minus the bool for if the user is
trying to quit. We'll get plenty more locals later.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Default)]
pub struct LocalState {
  pub frame_width: f64,
  pub frame_height: f64,
  pub mouse_x: f64,
  pub mouse_y: f64,
}
impl LocalState {
  pub fn update_from_input(&mut self, input: UserInput) {
    if let Some(frame_size) = input.new_frame_size {
      self.frame_width = frame_size.0;
      self.frame_height = frame_size.1;
    }
    if let Some(position) = input.new_mouse_position {
      self.mouse_x = position.0;
      self.mouse_y = position.1;
    }
  }
}
```

## `do_the_render`

This part is easy right now. We just make up some arbitrary color and clear the
screen to that. We'll use the mouse's position as a fraction of the total frame
size, so that the color shifts as the mouse moves. It's some sort of feedback at
least.

```rust
fn do_the_render(hal_state: &mut HalState, local_state: &LocalState) -> Result<(), &'static str> {
  let r = (local_state.mouse_x / local_state.frame_width) as f32;
  let g = (local_state.mouse_y / local_state.frame_height) as f32;
  let b = (r + g) * 0.3;
  let a = 1.0;
  hal_state.draw_clear_frame([r, g, b, a])
}
```

## `main`

Now we put it all together, and we get a final form that's pleasantly similar to
what our initial goal looked like.

```rust
fn main() {
  simple_logger::init().unwrap();

  let mut winit_state = WinitState::default();

  let mut hal_state = match HalState::new(&winit_state.window) {
    Ok(state) => state,
    Err(e) => panic!(e),
  };

  let (frame_width, frame_height) = winit_state
    .window
    .get_inner_size()
    .map(|logical| logical.into())
    .unwrap_or((0.0, 0.0));
  let mut local_state = LocalState {
    frame_width,
    frame_height,
    mouse_x: 0.0,
    mouse_y: 0.0,
  };

  loop {
    let inputs = UserInput::poll_events_loop(&mut winit_state.events_loop);
    if inputs.end_requested {
      break;
    }
    local_state.update_from_input(inputs);
    if let Err(e) = do_the_render(&mut hal_state, &local_state) {
      error!("Rendering Error: {:?}", e);
      break;
    }
  }
}
```
